Dataset: Prosper Loans

Main Findings
The goal of my analysis was to see which kind of borrowers would give me the best returns with least risk. While its easy to simple look at the two variables that mesure these specific
things, I looked at others as well. The main findings are as follows:
	- Loan Status (completed, cancelled etc.) can be well predicted with:
			* CreditScore
			* Debt to Income Ratio
			* CharacterScores > 10
	- Customers with Collateral - items that can be repossesed - specifically Houses, are better at paying off loans.
	- Credit Score of course is a good indicator as well, as they are better at keeping revolving balances low.
	
Choosing Visualizations
I had a lot more visualizations than what's in the final presentation. I wanted to however keep things precise and to the point, avoiding any fluff. I started off with some basic findings, like
credit score and ProsperScore distributions, then went on to show the highlights of my findings. I didn't want to include visualizations for the sake of including them and increasing the count.
